    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective Date: 7 Dec 2024</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle user information in our application ("App").</p>

    <h2>What Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not collect or store any personal data directly. However, our App uses third-party services (e.g., Google) for authentication, which may process your information as part of the login process.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>When using Google Login or other third-party authentication providers, your data (such as name and email) is processed by those providers. We do not store or share this information.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect or store personal data, there is no data retention policy.</p>
